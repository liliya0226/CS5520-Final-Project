# Data Model and Collections

Our data model is structured in a hierarchical fashion to represent relationships within the application:

**CRUD Operations:**

- **Create:** Register a new user profile.

- **Create:** Add a new dog profile under a user.
- **Read:** View details about a specific dog.

### Weights Collection

This collection is a subset of each dog's document, containing records and the date of records of the dog's weight over time.

**CRUD Operations:**

- **Create:** Log a new weight entry for a dog.
- **Read:** Access a dog's weight history.
- **Update:** Amend a weight entry.
- **Delete:** Remove a weight entry.

### Reminders Collection

Also a subset of each dog's document, this collection stores reminders for the potty time schedules.

**CRUD Operations:**

- **Create:** Set a new reminder.
- **Read:** Review upcoming reminders.

### Nutris Collection

Also a subset of each dog's document, this collection stores reminders for the nutrition log.

**CRUD Operations:**
